Objective: The overall aims of the course are for students to acquire:
1. The appropriate level of advanced theoretical knowledge required to interpret and analyse
contemporary and past environmental data for modeling.
2. The modelling skills required to investigate the interrelationships between environmental variables,
and to predict their responses to changing internal and external conditions.
