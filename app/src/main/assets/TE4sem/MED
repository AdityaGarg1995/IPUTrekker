Paper: Machine Element Design 3 1 4
Objectives: The primary objective of this course is to demonstrate how engineering design uses the many
principles learned in previous engineering science courses and to show how these principles are practically
applied. The emphasis in this course is on machine design: the design and creation of devices that consist of
interrelated components used to modify force and/or motion.
UNIT – I
Introduction: Principles of mechanical design, systematic design process, aesthetic and ergonomic
considerations in design, use of standards in design.
Manufacturing consideration in design, casting, machining, forging
Dynamic and fluctuating stresses, fatigue failure and endurance limit, stress concentration, causes and remedies
in design
Factor of safety
Tolerances and types of fits as per BIS
Selection of materials, designation of steels
Design of Cotter and knuckle joints.

UNIT - II
Design of Elements: screwed fastenings, bolted and riveted joints under direct and eccentric loads, initial
tightening loads in bolts. Welded joints, strength of welded joints, eccentrically loaded joints, welded joints
subjected to bending moment and torsion.
