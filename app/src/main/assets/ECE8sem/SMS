Paper: System Modelling & Simulation 3 0 3
Objective: The objective of the paper is to facilitate the students with the knowledge how something will behave
without actually testing it in real life. To ensure that the results of simulation are applicable to the real world,
students must understand the assumptions, conceptualizations, and implementation constraints of this emerging
field.
