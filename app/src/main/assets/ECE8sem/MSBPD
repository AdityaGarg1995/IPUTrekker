Objective: The objective of the course is to gain a basic understanding of microprocessor-based systems.
Fundamental concepts and techniques for designing and programming microprocessor-based systems will be
covered. The Intel 80x86 family of microprocessors and 80x86 assembly languages will be discussed during the
course.
