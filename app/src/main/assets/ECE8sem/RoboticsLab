List of Experiments:

1. Study of robotic arm, end effectors and its configuration and introduction to any software (such as workspace) used to simulate or program a robot;

2. Program / simulate a robot for moving on a path

3. Program / simulate a robot for pick and place operation

4. Program / simulate a robot for welding operation

5. Program / simulate a robot for water jet machining

6. Program / simulate a robot for saving it from striking any other object in workspace

7. Program / simulate two robots working together

8. Make a 3R robot and simulate its motion

9. Use a microcontroller to program simple toy robot / model robot

10. Micro controller program to use different sensors and further move toy robot(s) / model robot

11. Use MATLAB / Scilab. Any other software to program numericals (Robot Arm kinematics) taught in class

12. Use MATLAB / Scilab and other robot specific software like Robo-Analizer for the study of kinematic and dynamics of 3R robots

13. Demos of a real robot; Introduce Virtual Robotics Lab. in ADAMS or SimMechanics of MATLAB


Note:

a. Total Experiments are to be 12 (Twelve).

b. Experiments suggested by committee are given above- Choose any eight.

c. Rest (In above list / not in list) is liberty of respective institute to choose as per syllabus.

d. Suggested Software

A course on Robotics must use one or more software to not only visualize the motion and characteristics
of robots but also to analyzer/synthesize/design robots for a given application (say, as class projects).

Typical software which can be used are as follows:
• RoboAnalyzer (Developed by IIT Delhi; http://www.roboanalyzer.com)
• Virtual Labs. (Developed by IIT Kharagpur; http://vlabs.iitkgp.ernet.in/moodle/)
• MATLAB, its modules Simulink and SimMechanics (http://www.mathworks.com)
• Mathematica: Symbolic software (http://www.wolfram.com)
• Multi Bondgraph (http://bondgraph.org)
• ADAMS (by MSC software; http://www.mscsoftware.com)
• RerurDyn (by Function Bay, Korea; http://www.functionbay.co.kr)

e. Other Aids
• Possible Class projects and presentations: Kinematic/Dynamic modeling, programming, and analyses of a robotic arm (say, an RP manipulator); 2. Modeling of an AGV; 3. Building prototypes using, say, LEGO kits
• Video of practical applications
• Industry visits
• Robocon competitions: A national-level competition held every year during the 1st weekend of March


NOTE:- At least 8 Experiments out of the list must be done in the semester.
