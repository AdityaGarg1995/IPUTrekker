Paper: Robotics 3 0 3
Objective: To introduce the foundations of robotics. Also, a course on Robotics must use one or more software to
not only visualize the motion and characteristics of robots but also to analyzer/synthesize/design robots for a
given application.
UNIT - I

Robot definition, automation and robotics, Robot anatomy, Work volume, Drive systems. Control systems and
dynamic performance. Accuracy and repeatability. Sensors and actuators used in robotics. Machine Vision,
Robot configurations, Path control. Introduction to robot languages. Applications; Types (Mobile, Parallel);
Serial: Cartesian, Cylindrical, etc.; Social Issues
