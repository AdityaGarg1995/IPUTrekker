*NCC/NSS can be completed in any one semester from Semester 1 – Semester 4. It will be evaluated internally by
the respective institute. The credit for this will be given after fourth Semester for the students enrolled from the
session 2014-15 onwards.
NOTE: 4 weeks Industrial / In-house Workshop will be held after fourth semester. However, Viva-Voce will be
conducted in the fifth semester (ETEE 359).
@ A few lab experiments must be performed using any circuit simulation software e.g.
PSPICE/MATLAB/ETAP.
