Objective: The course refers primarily to Laminar and Turbulent flow concepts, pipe flow and open channel
flow concepts. Further, the course covers concepts of movement and transformation of pollutants released in the
atmospheric environment.

through pipes, Dimensional Analysis and Modal Studies, Velocity distribution in turbulent flow; shear stress
due to turbulence, turbulent flow in circular pipes, resistance of smooth and artificially roughened pipes,
General resistance diagram.

UNIT III
Open Channel Flow: Derivation of the general one-dimensional equations of continuity, momentum and
energy used in open channel flow analysis, Steady non-uniform flows, channel transitions and controls,
hydraulic jumps surges, Unsteady flow in open channels, Method of characteristics, surge formation,
Kinematics of waves, flood routing and overhead flow Turbines.
