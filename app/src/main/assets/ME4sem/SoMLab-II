Paper Code: ETME-254 L T/P C
Paper: Strength of Materials-II Lab 0 2 1
List of Experiments:
1. Study of performance of Fatigue & Creep tests
2. To perform bending test on beam (wooden or any other material) and to determine the Young's modulus
and Modulus of rupture
3. To find the Shear Modulus of Elasticity of two different materials; Aluminum and Steel using two twist
and bent test rigs are used.
4. To determine the Modulus of Elasticity and Poisonâ€™s ratio of Aluminum, the specimen being a
cantilever beam, and compare them with theoretical value
5. To determine principal stresses and strains in a beam made of aluminum and loaded as a cantilever, and
compare them with theoretical values
6. Flexural test on beam (central point load)
7. Flexural test on beam (two point load)
8. Determination of Bucking loads of long columns with different end conditions.
NOTE:- At least 8 Experiments from the list must be done in the semester.
