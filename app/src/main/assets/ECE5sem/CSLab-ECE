List of Experiments:


1. Comparison of open loop & closed loop control in speed control of D.C. motor & to find the transfer function

2. Study characteristics of positional error detector by angular displacement of two servo potentiometers
   a. excited with dc
   b. excited with ac

3. Study synchro transmitter in terms of position v/s phase and voltage magnitude with respect to rotor voltage magnitude /phase

4. Study remote position indicator systems using synchro transmitter/receiver

5. Plot speed-torque curves for ac servomotor for different voltages

6. Study ac motor position control system & to plot the dynamic response & calculate peak time, settling time, peak overshoot, damping frequency, steady state error etc

7. Study the time response of simulated linear systems

8. Study the performance of PID Controller

9. Plot impulse response, unit step response, unit ramp response of any 2nd order transfer function on same graph using MATLAB

10. Draw the magnetization(Volt Amps) characteristics of the saturable core reactor used in the magnetic amplifier circuits

11. Plot root locus for any 2nd order system (with complex poles). For Mp=30%, find the value of K using MATLAB

12. Design lead-lag compensator for the given process using Bode plots in MATLAB

NOTE:- At least 8 Experiments out of the list must be done in the semester.
