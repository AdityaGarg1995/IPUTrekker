List of Experiments:

1. Generate DSB-SC AM signal using balanced modulator

2. Study amplitude demodulation by linear diode detector

3. Generate SSB-AM signal

4. Study envelop detector for demodulation of AM signal and observe diagonal peak clipping effect

5. Generate FM signal using voltage controlled oscillator

6. Generate a FM Signal using Varactor & reactance modulation

7. Detect FM Signal using PLL & Foster-Seelay method

8. Study Super heterodyne AM receiver and measurement of receiver parameters viz.sensitivity, selectivity & fidelity

9. Study Pre-emphasis and De-emphasis in FM

10. Generate Phase modulated and demodulated signal


Simulations study of some of the above experiments using P-spice or Multisim softwares
