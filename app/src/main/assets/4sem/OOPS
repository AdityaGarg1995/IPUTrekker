Paper: Object Oriented Programming


UNIT – 1:
Objects, relating to other paradigms (functional, data decomposition), basic terms and ideas (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).
Review of C, difference between C and C++, cin, cout, new, delete operators.
[T1,T2]

UNIT – II:
Encapsulation, information hiding, abstract data types, object & classes, attributes, methods.
C++ class declaration, state identity & behavior of an object, constructors & destructors, instantiation of objects, default parameter value, object types, C++ garbage collection, dynamic memory allocation, metaclass/abstract classes.
[T1,T2]

UNIT – III:
Inheritance, Class hierarchy, derivation – public, private & protected.
Aggregation, composition vs classification hierarchies, polymorphism, categorization of polymorphic techniques, method polymorphism, polymorphism by parameter, operator overloading, parametric polymorphism, generic function – template function, function name overloading, overriding inheritance methods, run-time polymorphism.
[T1,T2]

UNIT – IV:
Standard C++ classes, using multiple inheritance, persistent objects, streams and files, namespaces, exception handling, generic classes.
Standard template library: Library organization and containers, standard containers, algorithm and Function objects, iterators and allocators, strings, streams, manipulators, user defined manipulators, vectors, valarray, slice, generalized numeric algorithm.
