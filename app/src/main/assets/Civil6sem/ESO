Objective: The course aims to introduce fundamentals and need for optimization techniques in engineering
problems. Various techniques such as Linear Programming, Geometric Programming, Dynamic Programming
and Non-Linear Programming are taught to students to solve various environmental engineering problems for
optimal solutions.
