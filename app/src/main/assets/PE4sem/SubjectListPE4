*NCC/NSS can be completed in any semester from Semester 1 â€“ Semester 4. It will be evaluated internally by the
respective institute. The credit for this will be given after fourth Semester for the students enrolled from the
session 2014-15 onwards.
@ A few lab experiments must be performed using any circuit simulation software e.g.
PSPICE/MATLAB/ETAP/Scilab/LabVIEW.
NOTE: 3-4 weeks In-house Power Plant Training will be held after fourth semester (Summer
Vacations).However, Viva-Voce will be conducted in the fifth semester (ETPE 361).
