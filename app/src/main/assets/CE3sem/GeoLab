Paper: Geology and Building Material Lab


Based on theory 8-10 experiments are to be performed. The list is provided below:


ENGINEERING GEOLOGY

1. Study of Geological map and section of local area

2. Study the various properties of igneous rocks, sedimentary and metamorphic through rocks samples

3. Study the various properties of different minerals and mineral ores through samples

4. Study the various types of folds and faults

5. Physical properties of minerals such as, hardness, colour, streak, etc

6. Numerical Problems related to Dip and Strike

7. Study of different geological features through models

8. Field visit


BUILDING MATERIALS

1. Assessment of physical properties of bricks, such as, absorption, shape and size, structure, soundness, hardness, presence of soluble salts.

2. Hardness, impact and water absorption test etc for stones

3. Study on different types of bonds for bricks and stones

4. Study on defects in timber
