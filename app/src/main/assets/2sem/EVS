      Definition, scope and importance of Environmental Studies.
      Biotic and a biotic component of environment, need for environmental awareness.
  (ii) Ecosystems
       Concept of ecosystem, structure and function of an ecosystem, producers, consumers and decomposers, energy flow in ecosystem, ecological succession, food chains, food webs and ecological pyramids.
       Introduction, types, characteristic features, structures and function of the following ecosystem:
         (a) Forest ecosystem
         (b) Grassland ecosystem
         (c) Desert ecosystem
         (d) Aquatic ecosystem (ponds, streams, lakes, rivers, oceans, estuaries).
  (iii) Bio-diversity and its Conservation
        Introduction to biodiversity â€”definition: genetic, species and ecosystem diversity, Bio-geographical classification of India.
        Value of biodiversity: Consumptive use, productive use, social, ethical, aesthetic and option values, Biodiversity at global, national and local levels, India as a mega-diversity nation, Hot-spots of biodiversity.
        Threats to biodiversity: Habitat loss, Poaching of wildlife, man-wildlife conflicts, rare, endangered and threatened species(RET) endemic species of India, method of biodiversity conservation.
        In-situ and ex-situ conservation.
