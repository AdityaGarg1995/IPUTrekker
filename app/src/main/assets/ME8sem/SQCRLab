List of Experiments:
1. To verify the various statistical relationships from the results of observations of 200 drawings from the
Shewhart’s Normal Bowl containing 998 chips and to fit a normal curve by making a histogram from
the individual observations. Take a subgroup of 5. The given statistical relationships are:
′ = σ′ = X s n σ′ = /d2 σ′ = / c2 σ′ = σσ / c5
2. To plot and determine the given unknown distribution from the results of observations of 180 drawings
from the given bowl containing 778 chips. Take a sample size of 4.
3. To determine the process capability of the manual sheet metal cutting process by cutting 80 rectangular
pieces (length = 30 mm & breadth = 25 mm) from 28 gauge G. I. sheet. Take a subgroup size of 5.
4. To plot p and np charts from the observations of 20 samples of 100 each drawn from the population of
3000 balls containing 5% defective balls.
5. To plot the , R & σ control charts from the observations of 120 drawings from the Shewhart Normal
Bowl containing 998 chips having population parameters as ′ = 30 and σ′ = 9.954, Take a subgroup
size of 5.
6. To state and prove the Central Limit Theorem. Take 180 observations from the Shewhart’s Normal
Bowl and take a sample size of 4.
7. To design a 2% A.O.Q.L single sampling plan by inspecting a population of 3000 balls submitted in 10
lots of 300 balls each with a process average as 0.3% to 3.0% in steps of 0.3%.
8. To plot control chart for c from the observations of 24 sample items drawn from population of 110
items.
9. To design a sequential sampling plan in which the producer's risk of rejecting the lots containing 5%
defectives is 4% and the consumer's risk of accepting the lots containing 30% defectives is 20%. Use
the designed sampling plan to inspect a population having process average 6% to 30% in steps of 6%.
The maximum number of pieces to be inspected is 24.
NOTE:- At least 8 Experiments out of the list must be done in the semester.
