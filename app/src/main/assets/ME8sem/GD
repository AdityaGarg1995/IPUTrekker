Objective: The objective of this paper is to introduce the students about the knowledge of basic
concepts and isentropic flows of energy in gas dynamics.
UNIT- I
Basic Concepts and Isentropic Flows:
Energy and momentum equations of compressible fluid flows – Stagnation states, Mach waves and
Mach cone – Effect of Mach number on compressibility – Isentropic flow through variable ducts –
Nozzle and Diffusers – Use of Gas tables.

UNIT- II
Flow through Ducts:
Flows through constant area ducts with heat transfer (Rayleigh flow) and Friction (Fanno flow)
variation of flow properties – Use of tables and charts – Generalized gas dynamics.
