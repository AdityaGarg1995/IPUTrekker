* Some lab experiments must be performed using any circuit simulation software e.g.
PSPICE/Scilab/MATLAB/LabVIEW etc.
** NCC/NSS can be completed in any one semester from Semester 1 – Semester 4. It will be evaluated internally
by the respective institute. The credit for this will be given after fourth Semester for the students enrolled from
the session 2014-15 onwards.
NOTE: 4 weeks Industrial / In-house Electronic Workshop/PCB making and assembling/Use of CAD software
(Lab needs to be developed) will be held after fourth semester. However, Viva-Voce will be conducted in the
fifth semester.
