#NUES (Non University Examination System)
@ A few lab experiments must be performed using any circuit simulation software e.g.
PSPICE/MATLAB/ETAP.
NOTE: 3-4 weeks In-house Electrical Workshop will be held after fourth semester (Summer
Vacations).However, Viva-Voce will be conducted in the 5th semester (ETEL-359).
