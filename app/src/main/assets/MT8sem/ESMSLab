List of Experiments:
A. Mechanical Event Simulation:
The students are exposed to simulating in CAD software in this lab ( software can be choice of institute â€“
such as PROE - wildfire 5 / PROE -CREO / NX / Solid Edge / solid works / Catia / any other.
1. Study assembly module on CAD software;
2. Simulate movement of cam and follower mechanism on CAD software.
3. Simulation of Spring Mass Damper System and do dynamic analysis on CAD software.
4. Perform FEM Analysis (using a simple 3D tetrhedran element) on a Simple model with pressure
loading and surface constraints;
5. Perform stress analysis of rectangular L bracket using Pro E / any other software and do global
sensitivity analysis.
B. System Simulation:
