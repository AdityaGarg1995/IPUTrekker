List of Experiments:


1. Configuration and logging to a CISCO Router and introduction to the basic user Interfaces.
   Introduction to the basic router configuration and basic commands.

2. Configuration of IP addressing for a given scenario for a given set of topologies.

3. Configure a DHCP Server to serve contiguous IP addresses to a pool of four IP devices with a default gateway and a default DNS address.
   Integrate the DHCP server with a BOOTP demon to automatically serve Windows and Linux OS Binaries based on client MAC address.

4. Configure, implement and debug the following: Use open source tools for debugging and diagnostics.
   a. ARP/RARP protocols
   b. RIP routing protocols
   c. BGP routing
   d. OSPF routing protocols
   e. Static routes(check using netstat)

5. Configure DNS: Make a caching DNS client, and a DNS Proxy; implement reverse DNS and forward DNS, using TCP dump/Wireshark characterise traffic when the DNS server is up and when it is down.

6. Configure FTP Server on a Linux/Windows machine using a FTP client/SFTP client characterise file transfer rate for a cluster of small files 100k each and a video file of 700mb.Use a TFTP client and repeat the experiment.

7. Configure a mail server for IMAP/POP protocols and write a simple SMTP client in C/C++/Java client to send and receive mails.

8. Implement Open NMS+ SNMPD for checking Device status of devices in community MIB of a linux PC. Using yellow pages and NIS/NFS protocols implement Network Attached Storage Controller(NAS).
