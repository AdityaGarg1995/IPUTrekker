Paper: Concurrent Engineering 3 0 3
Objective: The student will able to learn about concurrent engineering which will going to merge as discipline
to help the objective of reduced cost, better quality and improve delivery performance.
UNIT- I
Components of QFD, Limitations in deploying QFD, QFD methodology, Product life cycle, quality products,
evaporative markets, globalization and Concurrent engineering. Review of concurrent engineering techniques
like DFM (design for manufacture). DFA (design for assembly), QFD (quality function deployment), RP (rapid
prototyping), TD (total design) for integrating these technologies.
