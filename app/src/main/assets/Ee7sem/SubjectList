# NON UNIVERSITY EXAMINATION SYSTEM
Imp:- Elective Paper will be floated if one-third of the total students opt for the same. It is advised that the
decision about the elective subject for 8th Semester is done before 15th November every year before end of

respectively.

+ The student will submit a synopsis at the beginning of the semester for approval from the departmental
committee in a specified format, thereafter he/she will have to present the progress of the work through seminars
and progress reports.

^Industrial training was conducted after sixth semester. However, Viva-Voce for evaluation of Practical Training
will be conducted in this semester.

**Syllabus may be revised every 2 years.

@ A few lab experiments must be performed using any circuit simulation software e.g. MATLAB/LABVIEW
