Paper Code: ETMA-252 L T/P C
Paper: Numerical Analysis and Statistical Techniques Lab 0 2 1


List of Experiments:-

1. Solution of algebraic and transcendental equation.

2. Algebra of matrices: Addition, multiplication, transpose etc.

3. Inverse of a system of linear equations using Gauss-Jordan method.

4. Numerical Integration.

5. Solution of ordinary differential equations using Runge-Kutta Method.

6. Solution of Initial value problem.

7. Calculation of eigen values and eigen vectors of a matrix.

8. Plotting of Unit step function and square wave function.


It is expected that atleast 12 experiments be performed, including the above specified 8 experiments which are
compulsory. The remaining experiments may be developed by faculty and students based on applications of
Mathematics in Real Life problem.
