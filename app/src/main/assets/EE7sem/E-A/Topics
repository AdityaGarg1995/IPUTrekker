Paper: Selected Topics in EE 3 0 3
Objective: The objective of this paper is to introduce the student about induction Generator, Harmonics in
Electrical Machine, Solar photovoltaic system and other related functions
UNIT I
Induction Generator: Torque-speed characteristics of an induction machine under generation mode, Line/grid
Connected Induction Generator : Operation and limitations, Self Excited Induction Generator (SEIG) : Process of
self excitation, conditions of self excitation, critical capacitance curve, no load characteristics (terminal
capacitance vs induced voltage at constant speed), load characteristics (terminal voltage vs load current at fixed
terminal capacitance & constant speed), frequency characteristics (frequency of generated voltage vs resistive
load current) and voltage characteristic improvement using additional capacitor (capacitance vs resistive load
current keeping terminal voltage and speed constant).
