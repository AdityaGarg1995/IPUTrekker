Paper: Telemetry & Data Acquisition System 3 0 3
Objective: Telemetry is the study of data communication between a numbers of locations. Data Acquisition
system deals with acquiring the data from different sources, processing the data so that it can be made
compatible to be used with the controlling systems. So, the study of this subject is very useful for the students who
are to work in automation industries.
