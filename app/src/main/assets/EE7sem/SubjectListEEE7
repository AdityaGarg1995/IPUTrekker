# NON UNIVERSITY EXAMINATION SYSTEM
@ A few lab experiments must be performed using any circuit simulation software e.g. Scilab/LABVIEW.
+ The student will submit a synopsis at the beginning of the semester for approval from the departmental
committee in a specified format, thereafter he/she will have to present the progress of the work through seminars
and progress reports.
$ Elective Paper will be offered if one-third of the total students opt for the same. It is mandatory that the decision
about the elective subject is made before the 15th April every year before end of sixth semester. New Electives
may be added as per requirement after getting it duly approved by BOS and AC respectively.
^Industrial training was conducted after sixth semester. However, Viva-Voce for evaluation of Practical Training
will be conducted in this semester.
**Syllabus may be revised every 2 years.
