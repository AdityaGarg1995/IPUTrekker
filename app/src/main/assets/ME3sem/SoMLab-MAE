Paper Code: ETAT-257 L T/P C
Paper: Strength of Material Lab 0 2 1


List of Experiments:


1. To perform tensile test in ductile and brittle materials and to draw stress-strain curve and to evaluate various mechanical properties.

2. To perform compression test on C.I. and to determine ultimate compressive strength.

3. To perform shear test on different materials and determine ultimate shear strength.

4. To perform hardness test (Rockwell, Brinell & Vickerâ€™s test) on different materials (aluminium, steel, C.I, wood, Alloy Steel)

5. To perform impact test to determine impact strength.

6. To perform torsion test and to determine various mechanical properties.

7. Open Coil spring test.


NOTE:- At least 8 Experiments out of the list must be done in the semester.
