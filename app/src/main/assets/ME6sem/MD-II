Paper: Machine Design-II 3 1 4
Objectives: The primary objective of this course is to demonstrate how engineering design uses the many
principles learned in previous engineering science courses and to show how these principles are practically
applied. The emphasis in this course is on machine design: the design and creation of devices that consist of
interrelated components used to modify force and/or motion.
