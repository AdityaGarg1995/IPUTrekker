Paper: Structure Repair and Rehabilitation 3 1 4
Objective: To help students in understanding the various causes of structural failure and latest techniques in
repair and rehabilitation of structures.
UNIT I
Evaluating concrete in concrete structures: site survey, cracking, disintegration and spalling, scaling, dusting,
distortion, erosion, seepage, crack survey, joint inspections, physical and chemical analysis, NDT testing
Causes of distress and deterioration: Accidental loading, chemical reactions, corrosion, freezing and thawing,
settlement and movement, shrinkage, temperature changes.
[T1][No. of Hours: 12]
UNIT II
Materials and methods for repair and rehabilitation: planning and design of concrete repair, Autogeneous
healing, crack arrest techniques, drilling and plugging, Fiber reinforced concrete, flexible sealing, gravity soak,
chemical grouting, hydraulic-cement grouting, jacketing, polymer overlays, polymer coating, polymer injection,
polymer concrete, shotcrete, judicious neglect, shrinkage-compensating concrete.
[T2][No. of Hours: 12]
UNIT III
Maintenance of concrete: Stains and stain removal, cleaning details, oil stains, grease, dirt, mildew, asphalt,
efflorescence, coating and sealing compounds.
Specialized repairs: rehabbing lock walls, blasting lock walls, anchors, pre-placed aggregate concrete, cut-off
walls, under water repairs, geomembrane work.
[T1,T2][No. of Hours: 11]
UNIT IV
Trouble shooting defects in concrete: excess water, bad design data, chemical attacks, alakali-aggregate
reaction, freezing, moving water and cavitation.
