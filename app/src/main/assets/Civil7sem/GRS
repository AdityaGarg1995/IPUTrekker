Objective: To introduce the students to the different types of geosynthetics, their manufacturing technique,
testing methods and their applications in different types of Civil Engineering projects.
UNIT - I
Introduction: Historical background of reinforced soil, Principles of reinforced soil through Mohr circle
analysis.
Different types of geosynthetics: Types of geosynthetics like geotextiles, geogrids, geonets, geocells, geocomposites,
their manufacturing methods.
Testing methods for geosynthetics: Techniques for testing of different index properties, strength properties,
Apparent Opening Size, In-plane and cross-plane permeability tests.
