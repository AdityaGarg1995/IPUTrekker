Objective: The course deals with various principles and requirements of irrigation scheme involving
canals/channels carrying clear or Sediment-Laden water, design of canal sections, sheet pile, cut-off walls,
canal fall, distributory head regulator, cross regulator, cross drainage structures, canal head works, dams,
spillways, guide bank and bank protection.
