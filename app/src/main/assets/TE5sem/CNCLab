interpolation, circular interpolation; study of tools & zero offsets.
2. Study of Duplo-standard CNC lathe – programming codes- programs for simple components using
linear interpolation, circular interpolation ; study of tools & zero offsets.
3. Create a part program for component using canned cycles on Graziano or Duplo-standard CNC lathe
for internal drill, boring & simulate in the software.
4. Create a part program for component using cycles of thread cutting and grooving operation on
Graziano or Duplostandard CNC lathe & simulate in the software.
