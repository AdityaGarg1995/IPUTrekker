UNIT-I
Performance & Efficiency Calculations
Introduction, Need for performance monitoring, uncontrollable factors, basic requirements. Factors influencing
performance of boilers and optimization (Fuel properties, excess air, finess of P.F. etc.).
Performance Monitoring of Boiler Auxiliaries (Pulverisers, factors, sampling of pulverized, coal classifier
adjustments, mill rejects, causes and remedies) Air Heaters (effect of AH outlet temperature, performance tests)
Fans) Fans (Performance, curves, optimum operating point). Boiler efficiency calculation (Direct method,
calculation, limitations in adopting direct method.) Losses method, other standard method
[T1][T2]

UNIT-II
Factors influencing performance of turbine (Steam pressure, temperature and back pressure, cylinder efficiency,
deposits on turbine blades, blade roughness, effect of loading). Turbine Losses. Factors affecting performance of
condenser and feed heater (TTD, CW inlet, temperature, CW flow, heat transfer across tubes) Heaters (air
accumulation, steam side/water side fouling drainage, effect of attemperation in reheaters) Heat balancing
[T1][T2]

UNIT-III
Turbine heat rate calculation: Method, parameters required). Optimization of auxiliary power consumption (scope
variable speed drives, operation of un-necessary running auxiliaries).
Logging and recording (Scope of logging and recording, use of DAS/DDC in performance monitoring).
Discussion and appraisal. Maintenance Planning And Cost Control: Aims and objective of maintenance efficient
service, high plant availability, maintenance and planning engineer’s duties. Integration of maintenance with
operational requirements, plant reliability, plant outages and daily work programmes.
[T1][R1]

UNIT-IV
Preventive maintenance of running units. Planning of major plant overhauls during shutdowns.
Planning techniques – critical path analysis, charting system etc. Purchasing and stores control –standards cost
codes, control of stores and store records.
Cost control, direct costs, indirect costs, outage costs, budgeting and costing work, budgetary control. Contract
procedures (conditions of contract, capital applications and procedures, project evaluation, interest and
depreciation charges.) Use of computers in maintenance planning. Group Discussion and practice.
