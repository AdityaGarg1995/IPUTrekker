Objective: To teach the fundamental concepts of Control systems and mathematical modeling of the system. To
study the concept of time response and frequency response of the system. To teach the basics of stability analysis
of the system
UNIT I : Control Systems - - Basics & Components
Introduction to basic terms, classifications & types of Control Systems, block diagrams & signal flow graphs.
Transfer function, determination of transfer function using block diagram reduction techniques and Mason’s Gain
formula. Control system components: Electrical/ Mechanical/Electronic/A.C./D.C. Servo Motors, Stepper Motors,
Tacho Generators, Synchros, Magnetic Amplifiers, Servo Amplifiers,

UNIT II : Time – Domain Analysis
Time domain performance specifications, transient response of first & second order systems, steady state errors
and static error constants in unity feedback control systems, response with P, PI and PID controllers, limitations of
time domain analysis.
[T1,T2][No. of Hrs. : 10]
UNIT III : Frequency Domain Analysis
Polar and inverse polar plots, frequency domain specifications and performance of LTI systems, Logarithmic plots
(Bode plots), gain and phase margins, relative stability. Correlation with time domain performance closes loop
frequency responses from open loop response. Limitations of frequency domain analysis, minimum/non-minimum
phase systems.

Concepts, absolute, asymptotic, conditional and marginal stability, Routh–Hurwitz and Nyquist stability criterion,
Root locus technique and its application.
Concepts of compensation, series/parallel/ series-parallel/feedback compensation, Lag/Lead/Lag-Lead networks
for compensation, compensation using P, PI, PID controllers.
