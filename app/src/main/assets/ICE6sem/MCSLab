List of Experiments:


1. Study of open loop and closed loop time/ frequency responses of first/second order LTI system

2. Conversion of transfer functions to state model of LTI system and vice versa

3. Determine State Space Model of a given system and determine its controllability and observability.

4. Analysis of Zero order hold and first order hold circuits.

5. Conversion of transfer functions to state model of discrete time system.

6. To determine state transition matrix of a given system.

7. Study of saturation and dead zone non-linearity using describing function technique of a relay control system.

8. To draw phase trajectory of a given non-linear system.

9. Experiments based on PLC applications e.g. Lift control models, pick and place module etc.

10. Study of operation of a stepper motor interface with microprocessor.


NOTE:- At least 8 Experiments out of the list must be done in the semester
