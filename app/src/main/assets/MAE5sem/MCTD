UNIT - I
Introduction:
  Definition of feed, depth of cut and cutting speed. Concept of specific cutting energy in metal cutting and Numerical based on calculation of machining time on lathe, drilling machine, shaper, milling machine and grinding machines considering specific cutting energy of materials.
Theory of Metal Cutting:
  Orthogonal and oblique cutting, tool geometry (ASA & ISO), types of chips, Factors affecting the chip formation, Cutting forces in orthogonal cutting and their measurement, Merchant circle and derivation of relationships between the cutting forces, chip thickness ratio, shear angle, stress and strain in the chip, work done and power required in metal cutting and ‘size effect’, apparent mean shear strength of work material.
